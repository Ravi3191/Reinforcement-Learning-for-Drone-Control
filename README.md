# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Drone-Control
This repository contains code for an Implementation of [Soft Actor Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290) integrated with ROS for Control of Drones. We use Flightmare a Photorealistic Simulator for controlling the drone and collecting the Dataset. 
Our Fork for the simulator can be found [here](https://github.com/Hersh500/flightmare)
